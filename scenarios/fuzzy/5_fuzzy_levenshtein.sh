# The Levenshtein score between two strings is the number of transformations 
# needed to change the first string to the second string. 
# For example, the Levenshtein score for baz>bat is 1. For baz>batter, it is 4.

# As you can see below, we get a list of first names having a transformation count 
# (Levenshtein distance) of 0, 1, or 2. First names are being split out using the 
# substring function above. This vastly increases the number of results, but it 
# also helps find the name if Iâ€™ve incorrectly guessed the spelling.
