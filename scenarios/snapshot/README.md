# Snapshot Scenario

This scenario is to be used as a demo for walking through the steps of a simple backup and restore. The process has various stopping points to allow the presenter to show the status of related files. This allows the audience to understand the steps of doing a simple backup and restore.

## Prerequisites

Run the setup steps in the main README file for the "YugabyteDB 3-node cluster (fuzzy) with two tables (artists and artwork) from the MoMA data set" cluster. This demo may work on other clusters, but has not been tested.

If you are using macOS, please install the `rename` function (perhaps with `brew install rename`).
